A) Installation steps

1) start the project with cli

django-admin.py startproject profiles_project .
python manage.py startapp profiles_api


2) add frameworks and apps on settings.py

'rest_framework',
'rest_framework.authtoken',
'profiles_api',


3) after that open runserver with manage.py

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 and go to 127.0.0.1:8000 domain

B) Create DB Model for django app

1) on profiles_api/models.py we have to create our db model

required modules:

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser
from django.contrib.auth.models import PermissionsMixin
from django.contrib.auth.models import BaseUserManager


2) we create a custom user model in models.py with decided django frameworks and classes.
after that we added the changes we did on settings.py

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'profiles_api.UserProfile'

3) Create django migrations

- connect vagrant server with 

"vagrant ssh"

- activate venv and use makemigrations with manage.py

"python manage.py makemigrations profiles_api"

- After that migration will be create, next is running the migration

"python manage.py migrate"

C) Create superuser

1) We have create super user for manangement side, we can create with django cli

"python manage.py createsuperuser"

- After that, it will ask a information about email, name and password(Sb15)

2) Enable django admin

- on profiles-api/admin.py we have to set our model and function before we created.

- and test it.

"python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" and go to 127.0.0.1:8000

- on 127.0.0.1:8000/admin section, we can login our superuser and management dashboard

D) Create APIView

1) We create an APIView in profiles_api/views.py

- APIView is a api response interfaces for users, they can get response diffrently according to methods.

2) We have to create endpoints for api urls on profiles_project/urls.py

- For example: 

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

    is for admins side console url endpoint

- We will create new urls.py in profiles_api, but first we have to include out new urls.py in the main urls.py

    path('api/', include('profiles_api.urls'))

- And than we will create and new path for HelloApiVÄ°ew on /profiles_api/urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('hello-view/', views.HelloApiView.as_view()),
    ]
